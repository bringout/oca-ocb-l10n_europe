# Belgium - Accounting


This is the base module to manage the accounting chart for Belgium in Odoo.
==============================================================================

After installing this module, the Configuration wizard for accounting is launched.
    * We have the account templates which can be helpful to generate Charts of Accounts.
    * On that particular wizard, you will be asked to pass the name of the company,
      the chart template to follow, the no. of digits to generate, the code for your
      account and bank account, currency to create journals.

Thus, the pure copy of Chart Template is generated.
