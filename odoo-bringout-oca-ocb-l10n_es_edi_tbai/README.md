# Spain - TicketBAI


    This module sends invoices and vendor bills to the "Diputaciones
    Forales" of Araba/√Ålava, Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa.

    Invoices and bills get converted to XML and regularly sent to the
    Basque government servers which provides them with a unique identifier.
    A hash chain ensures the continuous nature of the invoice/bill
    sequences. QR codes are added to emitted (sent/printed) invoices,
    bills and tickets to allow anyone to check they have been declared.

    You need to configure your certificate and the tax agency.
